            <h3>A new platform that uses artificial intelligence to make money online has been released to the public.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Artificial intelligence technologies like ChatGPT and Midjourney are currently taking the world by storm. What most people don't know though, is 
              that AI technology isn't new, infact it's been around for years.
              It wasn't until recently, programmers have discovered that if the average person can use AI technology to make money on their behalf, 
              removing human error, the potential for profit is huge - and that's just what "AI Trader" does, while you sleep.
            </p>

          </div>
          <div class="flex-item">
            <h3>3 biggest advantages of AI Trader</h3>
            <p>
              By far, the biggest advantage of this application is because of artificial intelligence, there is minimal manual work required. Some users are already earning 
              $14,750 per month, well above the average for similar apps that have insane membership fees.
              Secondly, the app has a simple user interface, so no technical knowledge or experience is required to use it. The app comes with an algorithm that can independently 
              determine which currencies or stocks to buy and which to sell in order to maximize profits
              Thirdly, withdrawals are fast (within 2 days of request) and reliable. Various payment methods are supported, such as cards, 
              online accounts or bank transactions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="flex-item">
            <h3>How does this app work?</h3>
            <p>
              To get started, you must deposit a small amount of funds in to your account balance so that the AI trading app can begin automatically buying and selling currencies, 
              shares or bonds in order to generate profit. All transactions are carried out in a relatively short time, from a few minutes to several hours.
              The way the app determines which currencies to buy and sell and at what time relies on the analysis of thousands of market 
              indicators, from technical analysis of charts to world news that affect the movement of values.
              The real power of this app that sets it apart from others is an advanced AI algorithm that analyzes thousands of such signals every minute and is 
              able to predict with extreme precision what to buy and sell at the right time to achieve maximum profit.


            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="flex-item">
            <h3>Can you really use this app to make profits?</h3>
            <p>
              AI Trader has been in closed beta for several months, with only a small circle of people receiving access
              when registrations first opened 2 months ago. Initial data indicates that the average revenue per user was
              just over $14,700 per month, but this depends mainly on the size of
              the investment and the development of the algorithm, which, according to the founders, is improving day by
              day and currently has a success rate of 92%.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="flex-container">
          <h3>We tried it ourselves: here are our results</h3>
          <p>
            To provide more realistic results of this app, we'll show you the results from the last 30 days of testing the app ourselves.

            After creating my account, I received a call from my personal account manager. The account manager was very helpful in getting 
            my account set up and explaining the whole process to me. After a short phone call I was ready to begin AI trading with the most 
            popular 3 instruments: currencies, bonds and stocks.
            <br>
            In the results "screenshot" below, you can see the weekly profit we withdrew which was generated by the AI Trader algorithm:
          </p>
          <div>
            <img src="assets/img/aitrader.jpg" style="width: 15rem;">
          </div>
          <p>
            In 30 days we had a 73% success rate. Since only professional stock traders have such results, this is yet another incredible testament 
            to the power of artificial intelligence technology that already far exceeds the capabilities of average humans.

            We managed to generate $24,152.01 profit in just over 30 days. Although this is not like the huge sums that traders on Wall 
            Street achieve, this result is very impressive if you consider that the app has done all of the work for you and that 
            its accuracy only increases over time.

          </p>

        <div class="flex-container">
          <h3>Registrations closing soon due to high demand</h3>
          <p>
            The founders of AI Trader decided to release the app to the public for a closed beta so that the app could collect data for their machine learning algorithm, 
            but after reaching this limit, registration will no longer be free, and new users will need to pay to use it.
          </p>

          <h3>Register your account now</h3>
          <p>
            There are several ways in which you can create your account for AI Trader, but due to high demand, most of them are 
            often unavailable and require you to join a waitlist.
            <p class="warning">
              As of 8 minutes ago, there are still 17 invitations available for AI Trader.

              <span class="writer">IMPORTANT:</span> You may only create one account per person. When registering, it is
              important that you check your details are correct because you will receive a phone call from your account

              After the verification, which takes about 2 minutes, you can start using the application immediately.

                  I was on the waitlist for ages and finally got an account. I wish I new about the direct signup link from this page that skips the waitlist. Anyways, 
                  I know others won't believe me, but I don't care. It's nothing revolutionary, it's an AI powered autotrading software that kicks in and automatically 
                  starts buying and selling currencies for you. The only difference from hundreds of other autotrading software is that this one has much better technology 
                  to predict price changes, so it is really effective and you can make a profit. From 
                  what I saw, right now it is limited to about $750 of profit per day per user, otherwise you could start turning hundreds of thousands when the 
                  ball starts rolling.

                  Yes it works, just like many private autotrading systems do, but unfortunately the rich keep it for themselves. This one was opened for 
                  public registration for short time, but I didn't manage to register. I tried opening a signup page, but it says its at a capacity. 
                  When will it be available again?

                  I managed to register :)) At first I thought I didn't want to share this with others, but then you realize that you don't 
                  lose anything if more people use it. Everyone can make money as this is currency trading and other people don't lose if you win. 
                  I started to make about $750 of profit a day since 5 days ago when I first started. You have to be lucky to get an account, but from what 
                  I see now, this direct signup link still works.
